# How do I rename an existing Git Remote?


### Here's an example

Let’s say that your current remote name is “origin_1”. And now you want to change the remote name to  “origin_2”.

**1. Confirm the name of your current remote by running the following command:**

```bash
git remote -v
```

You should see an output like the following

```bash
origin_1  https://github.com/username/repository.git (fetch)
origin_1  https://github.com/username/repository.git (push)
```

**2. Now that the current remote name is confirmed — you can change it by running the following command:**

```bash
git remote rename origin_1 origin_2
```

This command tells git to rename the current remote to something different. In this example, we’re changing the remote name to “origin_2”, but you can change your remote to be anything you want.

**3.  Verify that your remote has changed from “beanstalk” to “origin” by running the following command:**

```bash
git remote -v
```

You should see an output like the following

```bash
origin_2  https://github.com/username/repository.git (fetch)
origin_2  https://github.com/username/repository.git (push)
```
